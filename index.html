            <p>However much we try to frame Duolingo as educational, the reality is that we use our streaks to give us a psychological boost and an excuse to continue using Duolingo as entertainment.</p>

        <p id="postman">Neil Postman, author of “Amusing Ourselves to Death,” warns of the dangers of entertainment focused media because of the lack of critical thinking necessary to take it in. In the context of streaks on Duolingo, it's deemphasizing the language learning (the actual content) and placing the focus on the addiction to the entertainment. Duolingo tries its best to advertise itself as a learning resource, but after a few weeks, it's no longer about the intellectual gain but the entertainment and psychological value. It requires little critical thinking to pay for infinite hearts and stumble your way through a lesson on Duolingo to extend your streak and move up in your leaderboard (which is probably what a lot of people do) rather than actually focusing on the learning. This reveals that Duolingo is less of a true language learning resource and more of a reduction of language learning to entertainment, which we happily absorb.</p>
        <p id="mcluhan">Marshall McLuhan provides some important commentary on the nature of streaks. Through his point “the medium is the message,” he argues that the medium by which content is communicated is more impactful than the content itself. This is illustrated through Duolingo's streaks: their primary attraction is not the content (learning the language), but that of having done Duolingo (the medium), which we think of as a status symbol. The fact that Duolingo, the medium, makes it so easy for you to blunder through a lesson to extend your streak is much more impactful than what you supposedly learned, which you will forget in weeks. However, we don't think about this while we're doing Duolingo, and in this way we justify our addiction in our minds by framing Duolingo as an educational resource (thinking about the content), whereas we're really using it as a means to extend our streak, which we think of as a status symbol.</p>
        <p id="debord">Guy Debord, author of “The Society of the Spectacle,” gives us a viewpoint through which to examine streaks. His theory that our society values most “appearing” as something or someone demonstrates that streaks on Duolingo make us feel good because they give us the appearance of being intelligent and committed to learning. The important thing to realize is that this is not necessarily true: you probably don't actually know the language very well, but a long streak makes us appear to others that we do. In my experience, I have a 1000+ day streak, but I'm barely halfway through the Spanish course, and the majority of my Spanish skills come from speaking in Spanish class at school, not from Duolingo. In other words, Duolingo streaks are effectively meaningless, but they give us a psychological boost by making us appear impressive and intelligent.</p>
