            <p id="mcluhan">Marshall McLuhan provides some important commentary on the nature of streaks. Through his point “the medium is the message,” he argues that the medium by which content is communicated is more impactful than the actual content itself. This is illustrated through Duolingo: it primarily attracts people to return every day not by making them want to learn the language, but for the sake of having done Duolingo. In this way, we sort of justify our addiction in our minds by framing Duolingo as educational, whereas we're really using it for entertainment.</p>

        <p id="postman">Neil Postman, author of “Amusing Ourselves to Death,” warns of the dangers of using media exclusively as entertainment. In the context of streaks on Duolingo, it's deemphasizing the actual language learning and placing the focus on the addiction to content rather than the content itself. Duolingo tries its best to advertise itself as a learning resource, but after a few weeks, it's no longer about the intellectual gain but the entertainment value. It requires little critical thinking to pay for infinite hearts and stumble your way through a lesson on Duolingo, which is probably what a lot of people do, rather than actually focusing on the learning. Postman argues that we should be wary of this, and that we should make sure we are reflecting on what our true motivations for using Duolingo are.</p>
        <p id="debord">Guy Debord, author of “The Society of the Spectacle,” gives us a viewpoint through which to examine streaks. His theory that our society values “appearing” as something or someone demonstrates that streaks on Duolingo make us feel good because they give us the appearance of being intelligent and committed to learning. The important thing to notice is that it's not even that we necessarily know the language (from what I've seen, very few people that use Duolingo solely actually become fluent), but people think we do. This reveals that our thinking behind using Duolingo is more</p>
